      <p class="article-bold-paragraph">The holidays can be a stressful time of year at the best of times. But this year’s festive season is shaping up to be more challenging than usual due to COVID-19. With many parts of the country returning to lockdown, this year’s festive season will be different for many Canadians – and University of Toronto students, faculty and staff are no exception. In most places, large family dinners, gatherings and holiday parties will be ruled out due to public health restrictions that are aimed at promoting physical distancing and curbing the spread of the virus. Yet, experts from U of T and elsewhere say there are still many things you can do to find balance and care for your mental well-being over the holidays. Here are just a few tips:</p>

      <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <p>Physical health and fitness can have a significant impact on your mental health, so don’t wait to make a New Year’s resolution to get started. There’s a wide variety of workouts that you can do at home with no equipment needed other than just your body’s weight. Dumbbells and workout bands are also great options if you want to introduce some resistance into your work out. U of T’s Sport & Recreation division has made a series of workout videos, dubbed MoveU Anywhere!, that provides tips on quick, high-intensity workouts and YouTube abounds with hundreds of home workout videos to suit every strength and skill level. If you’re in the Toronto region, you can look to take advantage of the city’s skating rinks, recreational trails, toboggan hills, snowshoeing loops and parks to get some outdoor exercise.</p>

      <h2>Get some fresh air</h2>

      <p>Experts recommend trying to get outside for fresh air at least once a day to avoid feeling cooped up, clear your head and find some mental balance. To make it easier to maintain physical distancing, try heading out first thing in the morning or late in the evening – or use less busy streets and trails.</p>
       
      <h2>Connect with others remotely</h2>

      <p>While physical distancing continues to be of the utmost importance heading into the holiday season, there are still ways that you can maintain social connections with friends and family who aren’t in your household or bubble. Zoom or Skype calls, virtual dinners, online games and even old-fashioned phone calls are a great way to stay connected and check in on one another. In the lead-up to Thanksgiving and reading week, Vivek Goel, a renowned public health expert and a special adviser to U of T’s  president and provost who is helping guide the university’s pandemic response, offered tips on how to stay connected with family – tips that still apply over the winter holiday season. “You don’t have to be in the same room. It's time to be creative. There are family games you can do together online using different technologies. You can still do many of the things you're used to doing,” Goel said. “Of course, it’s not going to be exactly the same, but we need to explore other ways of interacting with each other for everyone’s benefit.”</p>

      <h2>Seek help if you need it</h2>

      <p>If you find yourself struggling and in need of help, talk to a family member or a trusted friend or reach out to a mental health professional to get the help you need.

      U of T offers an array of mental health services and supports, many of which can be delivered remotely. If you’re not sure of who to reach out to, a great place to start is the Student Mental Health Resource.</p>
