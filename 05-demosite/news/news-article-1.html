      <p class="article-bold-paragraph"> Here are our top ten most dramatic European alpine roads. We have selected these because they give the best combination of both good riding and spectacular scenery. We have ridden many such roads over the years and these are the ones we liked the most.</p>

      <h2>1. Gavia Pass, Italy</h2>
      <p>Almost everyone has heard of Stelvio Pass in Italy, but very few know about, or have ridden Gavia Pass, which is very near to Stelvio.  The SS300 runs south from Bormio to Ponte di Legno for about 26 miles and has just about everything a biker can ask for in a road.  It is high at 8,701 feet, it has some fast sweeping bends as well as some tight hairpins.  It has a glacier and it has magnificent views.  It has a narrow, tight section as well as a few long straights.  But the best reason we rank it as number 1 is it has very little traffic as most riders / drivers are drawn towards nearby Stelvio Pass, leaving Gavia relatively quiet.  Although the road surface is not great, it is one of the most exciting roads we have ridden that continues to put a smile on our faces every time we ride it.  It is Tour1’s favourite road.</p>

      <h2>2. Triglavski Narodni Park, Slovenia</h2>
      <p>In the very northernmost part of Slovenia, road 206 runs broadly south west from Kranjska Gora through the Triglavski Narodni Park.  This is a mountainous area with the road following the contours of the rugged nature of the mountains.  The road is narrow, with certain parts cobbled, but it is certainly good enough to ride and enjoy.  The views from the road are excellent.  Another great nearby road is number 902 within the park.  It is a dead-end toll road with spectacular scenery.  902 is to the east of Cave del Predil, across the border in northern Italy.</p>

      <div class="clearfix"></div>

      <h2>3. Grossglockner Pass, Austria</h2>
      <p>This is a stunning road set amongst very dramatic scenery.  Grossglockner Pass is a toll road that rises up to 8,215 ft in the Alps.  Near the top of the pass is a spur road up to the Edelweisspitze viewpoint.  The road to the viewpoint has tight hairpin bends and is part cobbled, but it is worth the ride up as the view from the top is one of the best in the Alps.  Another spur road takes riders to the longest glacier in the eastern Alps, the Pasterze.  Like most pass roads in the Alps, Grossglockner Pass is closed in winter.</p>
