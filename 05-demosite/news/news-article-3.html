      <p class="article-bold-paragraph">From massive EDM concerts by top-chart artists to digital sound producers for AAA gaming titles and Hollywood blockbusters to Soundcloud aspirants looking for their big break, is transforming the way people make music. Whether you’re a celebrated musician, an artist on the verge of his big break, or an aspiring sound engineer, we’ve come up with this list to help you identify the best laptop for music production of 2018.</p>

      <h2>MacBook Pro</h2>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="image-container col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>

      <p>The MacBook Pro is the go-to for musicians and music producers around the world and has been seen on-stage at even the biggest concerts and music festivals worldwide. The 2018 iteration of the 15″ MacBook Pro is said to be the best laptop that Apple has ever made, especially for musicians. While the MacBook Pro doesn’t see that much action in sound design and engineering, it is the best laptop for music production in 2018 – if you can handle the cost.</p>

      <p>The MacBook Pro stands out as Apple’s flagship laptop and, as expected from the innovation giant, the MacBook Pro reinvents a lot of things in its pursuit of top-tier performance, efficiency, and aesthetic. With the choice of the most powerful processors in Intel’s line-up, the i7 or i9 hexacore processors, and up to 32GB of RAM multitask like never before and completely submerge yourself in music production. The MacBook Pro not only boasts impressive things under the hood, but it’s pretty safe to say that this (figuratively) million-dollar laptop looks like a million bucks. A robust aluminum body makes the MacBook Pro sturdier than ever before, and with its 15.6″ Retina display, it delivers groundbreaking video performance as well as sound performance.</p>

      <p>It’s powerful, it’s beautiful, and it’s one of the best laptops for music production of 2018. If you don’t mind the $2,800 price tag for the base specs, the MacBook Pro is the way to go.</p>

      <h2>Dell XPS 15/13</h2>

      <div class="clearfix"></div>

      <p>Dell has been at the forefront of laptop technology for years, and with the latest iterations of the Dell XPS series, the power of 2-in-1 form factor PCs has made it viable and beneficial to productivity in just about every industry, music production included. Get the Dell XPS 15 for greater control over your audio workflow and max out your portability.</p>

      <p>The Dell XPS 15 laptop is a small but capable laptop designed for streamlined work processes, increased productivity, and better control of your workflows with the 2-in-1 form factor. Note that we said work processes, and while this incites mental images of documents and white papers and endless spreadsheets being worked on by number crunchers, there is no reason for these productivity-oriented features not to translate into music production.</p> 

      <p>Sound designers and music producers don’t have to compromise much if they choose the Dell XPS 15. Both the Dell XPS 15 and Dell XPS 13 are potent machines in their own right, but the Dell XPS 15 sets itself apart by being great 2-in-1 form factor laptops that come with the latest components and deliver unprecedented performance and productivity. The Dell XPS Series 15 comes with the best-in-class patented InfinityEdge display with microthin bezels that makes it the world’s smallest 15.6” laptop. But don’t let the size fool you – the Dell XPS 15 packs more than enough punch to see you through to the very end of your audio projects, and to help you get there like a champion. The Dell XPS 15 is priced at a modest $1,549 for the high-end configuration. Not a wrong price tag considering that this includes the Intel Core i7-8750H processor, 16GB of RAM, and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050.</p>
